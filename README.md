Google Summer of Code 2017
=====================
Joomla! CMSâ„¢ - Expand Extensions Manager
=====================

What is this?
---------------------

This is the repository of all my work done during Google Summer of Code 2017, where each branch here is one feature, you can see the Pull requests in the [project repository](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc17_expand_extension_manager/)

Blog Posts
---------------------

I made two blogposts for Joomla:

First Blogpost:

Final Blogpost:

Technical Notes
---------------------

Each feature needed a revision not only from my mentors but also from the core team in Joomla, so it was required also to make a Technical note explaining why the feature was necessary and the implementation.
 
Pull Requests
---------------------

There are 2 Pull Requests on each feature, the first ones are to the [Project Repository](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc17_expand_extension_manager/) where I had only review to my mentors and in the end they were made to the [Main Repository](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms) where they were reviewed by all the community
